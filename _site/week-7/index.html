    <p>Work slowed down a bit because I have been onholiday, so this blog covers from around the 13th of June to the 05th of July.</p>

<p>I have almost finished a whole twitter-like social app in the MEAN stack.  I need to finish it off with a few things like remembering users and testing.</p>

<p>I have also completed the small twitter listing app, some Three JS projects and some more 2d canvas apps to keep my hand in on the front end side of things.</p>
